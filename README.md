## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- Anthropic API key

### Installation

1. Ensure your `.env` file has your Anthropic API key:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if not already done):
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3300](http://localhost:3300) in your browser

### Running the CLI Version

The original CLI version is still available:

```bash
pnpm cli
```

## Usage

1. Select your target language from the dropdown
2. Start chatting with your AI tutor
3. Translate sentences provided by the tutor
4. Receive instant corrections and explanations
5. Progress through increasingly difficult challenges

## How It Works

Buzzling uses Claude's AI to:

1. Provide sentences in English for you to translate
2. Analyze your translations for accuracy
3. Offer detailed corrections and explanations
4. Adapt to your skill level (A1-C2 framework)
5. Generate appropriately difficult next challenges

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: React components with Vercel AI SDK's `useObject` hook
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with `streamObject` for structured responses
- **AI Tool**: Structured feedback via Zod schemas
- **Streaming**: Real-time responses for immediate feedback
